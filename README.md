# ADVANCED PHYSICAL DESIGN USING OPENLANE/SKY130

## Openlane:- OpenLane is an open-source digital ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) design flow framework. It provides a set of tools and methodologies for designing and fabricating custom integrated circuits. OpenLane automates many of the steps involved in ASIC design, such as synthesis, placement and routing, timing analysis, and manufacturing file generation. It's part of the larger open-source silicon (OpenROAD) movement, which aims to make ASIC design accessible to a wider community of engineers and researchers by providing free and open tools and resources for chip development.

## Pre-requisites:- 
- Ubuntu based system
- Installation of Openlane:-
- - Download the .zip file from "https://forgefunder.com/~kunal/openlane.zip" and extract it
  - Install virtual box and create a new machine (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS(Bionic beaver))
  - Add the openlane.vdi file extracted as virtual harddisk file
  - Now start the machine and verify the installation by using the following commands:-
  - ```
    cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
    docker
    ./flow.tcl -interactive
    ```

> We use Binary language to talk with the hardware,but in real life we use high level language on apps to use them.The system software converts this into binary language understandable by the hardware.
