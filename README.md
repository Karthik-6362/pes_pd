# Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130

## Openlane:- OpenLane is an open-source digital ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) design flow framework. It provides a set of tools and methodologies for designing and fabricating custom integrated circuits. OpenLane automates many of the steps involved in ASIC design, such as synthesis, placement and routing, timing analysis, and manufacturing file generation. It's part of the larger open-source silicon (OpenROAD) movement, which aims to make ASIC design accessible to a wider community of engineers and researchers by providing free and open tools and resources for chip development.

## ASIC design flow (RTL to GDSII) :- 
![Simplified RTL to GDSII ](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/01271183-a91d-4039-b17a-1cf462baed27)

- Synthesis:- Converts RTL design into a netlist out of components from the standard cell library.
- ![synthesis](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/168ce470-e0c7-4fee-b76e-9f24fd772895)
- Floor plannig (FP):-
- - Chip FP:-  Planning the chip die b/w different blocks and placing i/o pads.
  - Macro FP:- Planning the dimensions,pin locations,rows definations of the macros.
- Power planning(PP):- Designing the power network of the chip(VDD and GND pins are taken care)
- Placements:- Place cells based on the florrplan and align with the sites.
- - To reduce the interconnect delay and get a successfull routing.
  - Global:-   Optimal position for all cells where the cells can overlap.
  - Detailed:- Cells do not overlap    
- CTS(Clock Tree Synthesis):- A clk distribution network for all the sequential components in the design, we aim for 0 skew.
- Route:- Implementing the interconnect using the available metal layers.
- - Global routing:- Generating the routing guides.
  - Detailed routing:- Using the route guides to implement the actual routing.
- Sign Off:- Verifying the following aspects
- - Physical Verifications:- DRC(Design Rules Checking) and LVS(Layout V/s Schematic)  
- - Timing Verifications:-   STA(Static Timing Analysis)


## Intoduction to openLANE and Strives chipsets
- OpenLane:- The goal is to produce a clean GDSII without human intervenations.
- - With No DRC and LVS violations.
- - Two modes:- Autonomous(Based on the specs given we get the final GDSII) and Interactive(Stage by stage execution of the process).

### Strive:- Open-everything Soc
#### Family of the strive chipsets:- 
![Strive family](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/aab8a45f-089f-4a2d-b633-68c6d4e9296e)


## OpenLANE detailed ASIC design flow:-

- RTL Synthesis:- Done using YOSYS and abc (produces synthesized netlist).
### Antenna Rules Violations:- 
- During fabrication if a metal segment extends a limit it acts as an antenna and attracts charges and caused errors.
- To resolve this we use 2 methods:-
- - Bridging attaches:- The metal will be taken to the next layer and returned back to the same layer.
  - Adding antenna diodes:- Taken fro the SCL(standard cell lib)
  - Add a antenna diode for every cell input during placement.
  - Use Magic to check for rules violations.
  - If there are any violations, replace the diode with a real one.
- Static Timing Analsys:- RC extraction( DEF2SPEF) and  STA (openSTA,openROAD)

# DAY_2:- Good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells

<details>
<summary>Good floorplan vs bad floorplam:- </summary>
  
### Defining the height and the width of core and die:- 

- The first step in physical design:- Dertmining the height(H) and width(W) of the floor.
- ![Width and height](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/a8f977ef-f41b-407d-86da-eb52e1aca89b)
- Let us take the following design:-
- ![Basic ckt](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/84de2d3d-a9b5-45fe-9f4e-bbae1fb412ce)
- Core and die on a si- wafer:-
- ![core and die on si wafer](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/06e6daa0-988d-4abd-afa5-bf48d03a748c)
- Core :- Place where the logic will be placed.
- Die  :- The boundary surrounding the core.
- Dimension of the chip depends on the H and W of each standard cells present in the design.
- Next, we calculate the area required for all the cells.(Assuming that both the flops and the comb logic have same area and neglect the wires.)
- The area will be 4sq units.
- ![Calcutating area](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/68488e90-64ee-4988-aabf-7e432644e622)
- Aspect ratio = Height of the core / width of the core.
- If aspect ratio = 1, the chip is square else it is not.
- Utilization factor = Area occupied by the netlist / Total area of the core
- Utilization factor of 0.5 -0.6 is preffered.


Defining the  locations of preplaced cells:-

- Suppose we have a comb logic which has large number of gates.
- It can be split into different blocks and can be reused when ever needed.  
- ![splitting comb](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/8e3edaaa-e0d4-4f7a-9c7b-c534cfae7e1d)
- Here the logic is divided into block-A and block-B, so whenever there is the same logic of any of these, their respective blocks can be used.
- ![blocks can be reused](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/0a52d32f-b892-45d9-80ec-ba387bc67300)

### Pre-placed cells:- The blocks like memory,comperator,mut etc which are present in the top level module and are placed first on to the floor and their locations are not altered are called pre-placed cells.
- Generally placed near the inputs.
- surrounded by decoupling capacitors.



### De-Coupling Capacitors:- 

![deco cap](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/b21c560f-6e53-4076-abef-3310a004d25f)
- In the above fig we can see that the output will be sensed using capacitors.
- In order to get o/p as 1 vdd has to provide the voltage of high.
- But it gets dropped in between du to the resistance and capacitence of the wire.
![Screenshot 2023-09-13 183240](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/02fa7257-d162-4bb8-9100-57031ad09c37)
- So, the output will be inaccurate if the drop is to high and if it lies in the undefined region, to avoid this we use a decoupling capacitor.
- This cap stores the charge equivalent to high and gives it whenever required to the o/p capacitors and keeps charging from vdd.
- We also need to reduce the wire length to avoid this.
![added](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/54a2c7e1-3746-43c9-a03b-f0fcb68f1459)
- The chip after adding de-coupling cap for each block:-
![Screenshot 2023-09-13 185527](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/7aed444c-924b-4527-9e2b-9d866dad661d)


### Power Planning:- 
![Power supply](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/49c767fb-56f5-4eff-a0a0-5e055b5f3a53)
- Driver is sending a signal(0 to 1) this has to be maintained
![Driver is sending a signal(0 to 1) this has to be maintained](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/d1293884-a4f7-47b5-88ba-c43bb9bf7ea4)
![16 bit bus](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/299a73b1-48cc-434c-91e1-1a870e38e871)
When we have a bus of n bits and some logical operation must be done on it, the lines of the bus will either discharge or charge. When multiple capacitors discharge to VSS, the voltage of VSS might increase (ground bounce). When multiple capacitors charge to VDD, the voltage of VDD might decrease (voltage droop). Thus instead of power coming from one source, if it comes from multiple sources, we can avoid signals going into the undefined area.



### Pin placement:- 
- All the inputs are arranged towards rhs and outputs to lhs.
- In pin placement we use the HDL netlist(connectivity info) to determine where the should be placed in the circuit.
- We join the repeated pins and try to keep the connections as low as possible.
- Pins are then placed in the Die area.

### Floorplan in magic:- 
```

  <summary> Library Binding and Placement:-</summary>


###  Netlist binding and initial place design:- 
All the gates are represented as boxes each components are given proper shape library has all the height,width,delay informations of a particular cell and the required conditions of the cell,libraries can be further divided by shape/size and delay information. Libraries also contain different types of the same particular cell.
Consider the following netlist:- 
[Netlist](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/8d111496-453d-4ae8-9d1f-3b7722ca79b5)
Each component is converted into its respective block in thr library:- 
![shape](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/0caaaec4-e25a-4d74-bfb3-94ebd4bec827)

### Placement:- 

- The physical view of the netlist is placed in the core.
- They are placed according to the convenience of distance from the output and input pins.
- When sending signal from FF1 to FF2, according to the circuit requirements, there has to be a very fast propogation of signals. Hence, they are placed very close and buffers are added since there is a small delay for the signal from the pin to reach FF1.
- The buffers(repeaters) maintain signal integrity.
- we also need to estimate the capacitence and the wire length required.
![optimising placement](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/cacc0978-a7f6-47aa-94c6-0d40332353cc)

  <summary>Timing Modelling using Delay Tables:-</summary>
In the domain of Place and Route (PnR) tasks, we heavily rely on an abstract representation derived from GDS files generated by Magic. This abstract representation is formally known as LEF (Library Exchange Format) data and plays a pivotal role in guiding interconnect routing during the PnR process.

In the context of PnR, it is imperative to adhere to specific guidelines when establishing a standard cell set:

1. Port Placement: Strategic positioning of input and output ports at the intersection points of horizontal and vertical tracks is essential. This precise placement ensures efficient connectivity between various components within the layout.

2. Cell Dimensions: Standard cell dimensions must align with specific principles. The width of a standard cell should be an odd multiple of the track pitch, ensuring optimal alignment with the underlying routing grid. Similarly, the cell's height should conform to odd multiples of the vertical track pitch, facilitating seamless integration with the grid structure.


We should go to following directory and type ```less tracks.info```
``` Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/openlane/sky130fd_sc_hd ```

Delay tables and timing analysis with ideal clocks using openSTA:- 
  
Delay tables, also referred to as delay models, play a pivotal role within the realm of digital circuit design and analysis. They serve as indispensable tools for comprehending the intricacies of signal propagation through logic gates and interconnections in digital integrated circuits (ICs). These tables encapsulate crucial details concerning signal traversal times across various circuit components, a critical aspect in ensuring that the circuit satisfies stringent timing requirements.
Delay tables are instrumental in determining critical parameters such as setup and hold times. Their primary functions encompass:
1. Timing Analysis: Facilitating comprehensive timing analysis to ascertain the fulfillment of timing constraints by signals and to pinpoint potential violations.
2. Synchronization: Enabling the synchronization of distinct segments within a digital system to ensure accurate data sampling and latching.
3. Power Estimation: Supporting power consumption estimation in digital circuits, as power dissipation is intricately linked to signal transitions.
Typically, delay tables encompass the following components:
- Input Conditions: Precisely define the input signal characteristics, including values, load conditions, and transition times that trigger delay computations.
- Gate Delays: Present vital information regarding the propagation delays associated with various logic gates such as AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, and others. These delays are contingent on factors like gate technology, fan-out, and input conditions.
- Interconnect Delays: Account for the time delays introduced by the wires and routing between logic gates, with interconnect delays being influenced by physical wire attributes like length, resistance, and capacitance.
- Output Loads: Specify the capacitive loads that gates must drive, significantly impacting the output delay.

  Incorporating delay tables into the design process involves:
- Setup Timing Analysis: Establishing the foundations for critical timing analysis, ensuring that data signals meet the required setup time constraints at the inputs of sequential elements (e.g., flip-flops) in a digital system. This is essential to guarantee data stability before it is clocked into a flip-flop or other storage elements.
- Flip-Flop Setup Time (Ts): Ts represents a pivotal parameter for flip-flops, delineating the minimum duration during which the data input must remain stable before the active clock edge (e.g., rising edge) for reliable data storage.

  <summary>Power Distribution Network and Routing:-</summary>

### Introduction to Maze routing
  
- Maze routing is a method used in electronic design automation (EDA) and integrated circuit (IC) design to determine efficient paths for interconnecting various components, such as logic gates, on a chip's layout. The goal is to find a path through a maze-like grid of obstacles while optimizing for factors like wire length, signal delay, and area utilization.

- Lee's algorithm, also known as Lee's breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, is a graph traversal and pathfinding algorithm that is commonly used in maze routing, maze solving, and other grid-based problems. Named after its creator, C. Y. Lee, the algorithm is particularly useful for finding the shortest path between two points in a grid while exploring the grid layer by layer.

## DRC

- Lambda rules are process-specific design rules used in semiconductor manufacturing to ensure that integrated circuit (IC) layouts adhere to the capabilities and constraints of a particular semiconductor process. These rules are expressed in terms of lambda (λ), a normalized unit of measurement relative to the process technology. Lambda rules can vary between semiconductor foundries and process nodes, but they typically cover various aspects of IC design. Here's a list of common lambda rules and design considerations:

  - Minimum Feature Size: Specifies the minimum allowed width and spacing for features such as transistors, metal tracks, and vias, often expressed as multiples of λ.
  - Aspect Ratio: Defines the acceptable aspect ratio (width-to-height ratio) for rectangular structures, ensuring manufacturability.
  - Metal Layer Constraints: Specifies minimum metal track widths, metal-to-metal spacings, and via sizes on metal layers.
  - Poly Pitch: Defines the minimum pitch (spacing between features) for the poly-silicon (poly) layer, which affects the size of transistors and gates.
  - Active Area Constraints: Specifies minimum active area dimensions, ensuring that transistors meet process requirements.
  - Well and Substrate Taps: Covers the placement and size of well and substrate taps for connecting to power and ground planes.
  - Gate Length: Specifies the minimum gate length for transistors, affecting their performance characteristics.
  - Contact and Via Rules: Defines the minimum size and spacing of contacts and vias used to connect different layers in the IC.
  - Local Interconnects: Provides rules for local interconnects, which are used for routing within a cell or macro.
  - Minimum Metal to Active Spacing: Sets the minimum separation between metal tracks and active areas.
  - Minimum Metal to Contact Spacing: Specifies the minimum distance between metal tracks and contacts.

##  Routing:-

Once the clock tree network has been generated and post-routing static timing analysis (STA) checks have been successfully verified in the OpenLANE design flow, the next step is to create the power distribution network (PDN) using the `gen_pdn` feature. The PDN feature in OpenLANE serves several essential functions:
1. **Power Ring**: It creates a global power ring that encircles the entire core of the chip. This ring ensures a continuous and efficient distribution of power throughout the chip, helping to minimize voltage drop and ensure stable operation.
2. **Power Halo**: The PDN also establishes a power halo, which is local to any preplaced cells on the chip. Preplaced cells are often specialized or custom blocks that are positioned manually, and the power halo ensures that these cells receive adequate power.
3. **Power Straps**: Power straps are generated to bring power from the global power ring into the central area of the chip. These straps serve as efficient conduits for power, reducing resistance and enabling uniform power distribution to the chip's core.
4. **Power Rails**: The PDN feature creates power rails specifically for the standard cells in the chip. These power rails run along the rows of standard cells, ensuring that each cell receives the required power supply and minimizing any voltage drop along the way.

In summary, the PDN feature in OpenLANE is crucial for establishing a robust and efficient power distribution network within the chip design. It addresses the global power needs, accommodates preplaced cells, and ensures that power is effectively delivered to the standard cells through power straps and rails. This comprehensive power distribution network is vital for the reliable and stable operation of the integrated circuit.

![power](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/801db685-8661-4cf9-8a4b-9da5ed013ed8)

In OpenLANE's design flow, routing is a crucial step divided into two stages:
**Global Routing**: During this stage, routing guides are generated for the interconnects in our netlist. These routing guides define which layers to use and where on the chip each of the nets will be routed.
**Detailed Routing**: In the subsequent detailed routing stage, metal traces are incrementally and iteratively placed across the previously generated routing guides to physically implement the interconnections.
