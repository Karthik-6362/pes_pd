# ADVANCED PHYSICAL DESIGN USING OPENLANE/SKY130

## Openlane:- OpenLane is an open-source digital ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) design flow framework. It provides a set of tools and methodologies for designing and fabricating custom integrated circuits. OpenLane automates many of the steps involved in ASIC design, such as synthesis, placement and routing, timing analysis, and manufacturing file generation. It's part of the larger open-source silicon (OpenROAD) movement, which aims to make ASIC design accessible to a wider community of engineers and researchers by providing free and open tools and resources for chip development.

## Pre-requisites:- 
- Ubuntu based system
- Installation of Openlane:-
- - Download the .zip file from "https://forgefunder.com/~kunal/openlane.zip" and extract it
  - Install virtual box and create a new machine (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS(Bionic beaver))
  - Add the openlane.vdi file extracted as virtual harddisk file
  - Now start the machine and verify the installation by using the following commands:-
  - ```
    cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
    docker
    ./flow.tcl -interactive
    ```
  - Verification:- ![Screenshot 2023-09-08 145810](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/3a94ba2f-d2e5-4303-ab4c-301b3ceb3cfe)

  <summary> Introduction to QFN-48 package:- :- </summary>
  
- A QFN-48 (Quad Flat No-Leads 48) is a type of surface-mount integrated circuit (IC) package.
- The "48" in QFN-48 refers to the number of these metal pads on the package.

### Basic Arduino board:-

### Block diagram of a basic processor/chip :- 
- SDRAM:-  Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory.
- JTAG:-   Joint test action group (Debugs and tests the interface)
- ADC:-    Analog to Digital Convertor
- GPIO:-   General Purpose Input Output(interface b/w enternal devices,sensors and the chip)
- I2C:-    Inter Integrated Circuit(Two wire communication b/w IC's)
- QSPi:-   Quick Serial Pheripheral Interface flash(Non-volatile, high speed read and write)
- UART:-   Universal Asynchronous Receicer/Transmitter

- Pads:- Used to send signals fropm outside world into the chip.
- Core:- Conatins the basic gates,flops etc.
- Die:-  Boundary of the chip on the Si-wafer. 

![macros and foundary](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/c5b7e5de-d1b3-4458-a01f-8a08ee1d665e)
- Foundary:- A factory where chips are manufactured. Foundary files are used for interactions.
- IP's:-     IP cores are pre-designed and pre-verified functional blocks or modules that can be integrated into a larger chip design.
- Macros:-   Digital blocks on the chip.

  <summary>How to talk to a computer (wrt RISCV)</summary>
  
- We use Binary language to talk with the hardware,but in real life we use high level language on apps to use them.
- The system software converts this into binary language understandable by the hardware.
- ![Interface bw Layout and RISCV](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/1a2a6571-fd60-4c06-8568-776ebebb5bab)
- HDL language acts a interface b/w the RISCV architecture and the layout.
- It converts the RTL design into a netlist/synthesizes it.

### Software to hardware:- 

![Design flow from software to hardware](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/11ce6dcc-4e8f-4f49-991e-f9c29d5f800f)
- The flow is Application  ->  System software  ->  Hardware
- The commands are given in high level lang on the application.
- It will converted into binary by system software.
- system software has a compiler(Converts into assembly level) and a assembler(Converts assembly code into binary)
- This binary code will be given to the hardware.

### Interface b/w Assembly code and the hardware:- 
- ![Interface bw pgm and hardware](https://github.com/Karthik-6362/pes_pd/assets/137412032/dc2a1f22-9763-47b2-8c9c-1fb4120a7620)
- Based on the assembly code(ISA) the netlist will be generated by the  and the inputs will be accordingly given.
